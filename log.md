# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling. Continued to reinforce concept of using divs for centering/arranging content on a page.

**Takeaways:**  Adding navbar links within the page is surprisingly easy.

### Day 2: June 8, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling; almost finished. Improved mobile layout of devicons by 3-col rather than 1-col. Figured out how to link an image to Codepen via Dropbox

**Takeaways:** Linking images to Codepen was a bit tricky; you need to use http://dl.dropbox.com/... rather than http://www.dropbox.com/...

### Day 3: June 9, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Access Array Data with Indexes"

### Day 4: June 10, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Counting Cards".  Challenges: "Golf Code" and "Counting Cards".

**Takeaways:**  Reinforced knowledge of functions and program-flow logic.  Got more practice with switch statements, and was pleased to get the "Counting Cards" app on pretty much the first try.

### Day 5: June 11, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; currently on "Profile Lookup"

**Takeaways:**  Worked on data structures and loops.  Starting to get tricky; gonna need to spend more time on Profile Lookup.  Should review "Using Objects for Lookups" and "Nesting For Loops" again.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 6: June 12, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; still on "Profile Lookup", but making progress.

**Takeaways:**  Man, this one is tricky.  Finally realized that in order to run through an entire for-loop and pick out the target object, variables are needed for the object that meets the condition, as well as for the object's index.
