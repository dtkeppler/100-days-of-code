**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling; almost finished. Improved mobile layout of devicons by 3-col rather than 1-col. Figured out how to link an image to Codepen via Dropbox

**Takeaways:** Linking images to Codepen was a bit tricky; you need to use http://dl.dropbox.com/... rather than http://www.dropbox.com/...
