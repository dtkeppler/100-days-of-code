# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling. Continued to reinforce concept of using divs for centering/arranging content on a page.

**Takeaways:**  Adding navbar links within the page is surprisingly easy.

### Day 2: June 8, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling; almost finished. Improved mobile layout of devicons by 3-col rather than 1-col. Figured out how to link an image to Codepen via Dropbox

**Takeaways:** Linking images to Codepen was a bit tricky; you need to use http://dl.dropbox.com/... rather than http://www.dropbox.com/...

### Day 3: June 9, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Access Array Data with Indexes"

**Takeaways:**  Covered basic JS concepts I'm familiar with.  (Re-)learned how to access last object in array (or last letter in string)

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 4: June 10, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Counting Cards".  Challenges: "Golf Code" and "Counting Cards".

**Takeaways:**  Reinforced knowledge of functions and program-flow logic.  Got more practice with switch statements, and was pleased to get the "Counting Cards" app on pretty much the first try.

### Day 5: June 11, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; currently on "Profile Lookup"

**Takeaways:**  Worked on data structures and loops.  Starting to get tricky; gonna need to spend more time on Profile Lookup.  Should review "Using Objects for Lookups" and "Nesting For Loops" exercises again.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 6: June 12, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; still on "Profile Lookup", but making progress.

**Takeaways:**  Man, this one is tricky.  Finally realized that in order to run through an entire for-loop and pick out the target object, variables are needed for the object that meets the condition, as well as for the object's index. 

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 7: June 13, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC challenge "Profile Lookup" and the rest of intro to JS.  Moved on to OOP and covered constructor functions.

**Takeaways:**  It was VERY satisfying to finally get the "Profile Lookup" working. Learned about Regular Expressions (searches within strings), which will be useful.  It was helpful to have a refresher on Constructor functions.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 8: June 14, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Object-Oriented Programming section, and two "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  Reinforced knowledge of array methods. Found a use for RegEx's in removing non-alphanumeric characters from a string.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 9: June 15, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  I'm glad to see that I've come a long way as a result of the Tech Talent South JS class.  I would not have been able to complete these before, but now I am able to work my way through them, with some help from Stack Overflow.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 10: June 16, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  I've been trying out writing out the program logic in pseudo-code, which is helping. Also, I'm getting better at not panicking when I hit a stumbling block.

### Day 11: June 17, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Chunky Monkey, Slasher Flick, & Mutations)

**Takeaways:**  I want to try to ignore the "helpful links" listed; these won't be available in the real world.  One of the hard things is remembering what methods are out there, what they're used for, and which is needed for a given problem.

### Day 12: June 18, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Falsy Bouncer, Seek & Destroy, Where Do I Belong)

**Takeaways:**  "Seek & Destroy" was challenging.  There's a nice trick to convert arguments into an array.  Also, IndexOf was what allowed me to finally match up outer-array items with the inner-array items.  "Where Do I Belong is also tricky, but I think I'm getting close.

### Day 13: June 19, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Where Do I Belong, Caesar's Cipher)

**Takeaways:**  These last two were quite challenging.  Proof that if your code to do one thing is getting too complex, you're prob overthinking it.  Also, it helps to first think about what exactly your operator is checking for.  charCode methods are useful for using numeric operators on letters.

### Day 13: June 20, 2017 
#### Time: 1.75 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed "JSON API's and Ajax"; started on "Build a Random Quote Machine" project

**Takeaways:**  JSON, API's, and Ajax concepts were familiar from Tech Talent South, but I know I will need a lot of practice.  The random quote machine JS is already finished; I used a hard-coded array of objects for quotes.  (I considered using Ajax but couldn't find a good site to get data from).
