#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling. Continued to reinforce concept of using divs for centering/arranging content on a page.

**Takeaways:**  Adding navbar links within the page is surprisingly easy.

### Day 2: June 8, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling; almost finished. Improved mobile layout of devicons by 3-col rather than 1-col. Figured out how to link an image to Codepen via Dropbox

**Takeaways:** Linking images to Codepen was a bit tricky; you need to use http://dl.dropbox.com rather than http://www.dropbox.com
