# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling. Continued to reinforce concept of using divs for centering/arranging content on a page.

**Takeaways:**  Adding navbar links within the page is surprisingly easy.

### Day 2: June 8, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC portfolio styling; almost finished. Improved mobile layout of devicons by 3-col rather than 1-col. Figured out how to link an image to Codepen via Dropbox

**Takeaways:** Linking images to Codepen was a bit tricky; you need to use http://dl.dropbox.com/... rather than http://www.dropbox.com/...

### Day 3: June 9, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Access Array Data with Indexes"

**Takeaways:**  Covered basic JS concepts I'm familiar with.  (Re-)learned how to access last object in array (or last letter in string)

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 4: June 10, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; completed up to "Counting Cards".  Challenges: "Golf Code" and "Counting Cards".

**Takeaways:**  Reinforced knowledge of functions and program-flow logic.  Got more practice with switch statements, and was pleased to get the "Counting Cards" app on pretty much the first try.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 5: June 11, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; currently on "Profile Lookup"

**Takeaways:**  Worked on data structures and loops.  Starting to get tricky; gonna need to spend more time on Profile Lookup.  Should review "Using Objects for Lookups" and "Nesting For Loops" exercises again.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 6: June 12, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC Basic JavaScript course; still on "Profile Lookup", but making progress.

**Takeaways:**  Man, this one is tricky.  Finally realized that in order to run through an entire for-loop and pick out the target object, variables are needed for the object that meets the condition, as well as for the object's index. 

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 7: June 13, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC challenge "Profile Lookup" and the rest of intro to JS.  Moved on to OOP and covered constructor functions.

**Takeaways:**  It was VERY satisfying to finally get the "Profile Lookup" working. Learned about Regular Expressions (searches within strings), which will be useful.  It was helpful to have a refresher on Constructor functions.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 8: June 14, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Object-Oriented Programming section, and two "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  Reinforced knowledge of array methods. Found a use for RegEx's in removing non-alphanumeric characters from a string.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 9: June 15, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  I'm glad to see that I've come a long way as a result of the Tech Talent South JS class.  I would not have been able to complete these before, but now I am able to work my way through them, with some help from Stack Overflow.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 10: June 16, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges.

**Takeaways:**  I've been trying out writing out the program logic in pseudo-code, which is helping. Also, I'm getting better at not panicking when I hit a stumbling block.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 11: June 17, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Chunky Monkey, Slasher Flick, & Mutations)

**Takeaways:**  I want to try to ignore the "helpful links" listed; these won't be available in the real world.  One of the hard things is remembering what methods are out there, what they're used for, and which is needed for a given problem.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 12: June 18, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Continued "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Falsy Bouncer, Seek & Destroy, Where Do I Belong)

**Takeaways:**  "Seek & Destroy" was challenging.  There's a nice trick to convert arguments into an array.  Also, IndexOf was what allowed me to finally match up outer-array items with the inner-array items.  "Where Do I Belong is also tricky, but I think I'm getting close.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 13: June 19, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges. (Where Do I Belong, Caesar's Cipher)

**Takeaways:**  These last two were quite challenging.  Proof that if your code to do one thing is getting too complex, you're prob overthinking it.  Also, it helps to first think about what exactly your operator is checking for.  charCode methods are useful for using numeric operators on letters.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 13: June 20, 2017 
#### Time: 1.75 hour

**Today's Progress**: Completed "JSON API's and Ajax"; started on "Build a Random Quote Machine" project

**Takeaways:**  JSON, API's, and Ajax concepts were familiar from Tech Talent South, but I know I will need a lot of practice.  The random quote machine JS is already finished; I used a hard-coded array of objects for quotes.  (I considered using Ajax but couldn't find a good site to get data from).

### Day 14: June 21, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished with FCC "Random Quote Machine" app and styling.  Since it's a movie quote generator, I added images from IMDB for some added flair. I also created a function to tweet the current quote.

**Takeaways:**  The official Twitter docs weren't very clear or helpful for a beginner.  Rather, I used an excellent and simple tutorial at https://debugmode.net/2012/06/27/how-to-post-a-tweet-using-javascript/.  I know using official docs is the ideal starting point, but in a pinch, go with what works.

### Day 15: June 22, 2017 
#### Time: 2.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: I decided to make the quote generator more challenging by making it RESTful.  I created a second app with quotes from "http://quotesondesign.com/", but decided this was also pretty easy.  So I created a third app using the "https://forismatic.com/en" API.

**Takeaways:**  Even though the forismatic.com code was quite simple, it took some time to figure out how to construct the URL query string. (Basically [URL] + ? + [request parameters])

### Day 16: June 23, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: I continued to clean up my two RESTful quote apps.  Mostly did some styling and tweaked the Tweet code.  

**Takeaways:**  It looks like there's a network-restriction problem with the Forismatic API.  I got around it with a Chrome extension that enables CORS, but when it's turned on, I can't tweet.  I'll need to work on this more down the road.

### Day 17: June 24, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the "Quotes on Design" app.  Spent most of the time trying to figure out how to remove the "<p>" tags from the returned property string.  

**Takeaways:**  I finally realized these aren't actually HTML tags; they are part of the string in the JSON object's properties. Whoops!

### Day 18: June 25, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the "Quotes on Design" app, and made two significant fixes:
1) I got the tweet alert-box to stop propogating multiple times 
2) I used .replace() on the ASCII code for apostrophes

**Takeaways:**  Again, if a problem is getting too complex, there's likely a simpler solution (ie. the replace method.)  Also, I realized that I had figured it out before, but didn't use the "global" feature so not all were being replaced.

### Day 19: June 26, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Finished up and submitted my "Quotes on Design" app.  My last updates were:
1) Got tweet to include the quote author's name
2) I chained multiple .replace() methods to replace other ASCII codes and HTML tags

**Takeaways:**  I'm going to need to go back to the replace method fix, as it feels like a hack.  However, I spent a lot of time and didn't find a fix that addressed my problem in a more effective way.

### Day 20: June 27, 2017 
#### Time: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Local Weather app project.  I've enabled the geolocation and tried creating an ajax "get" request, but CORS is again a problem. I'll need to look into a proxy server (this was also recommended by some on the FCC forum).

**Takeaways:**  1) CORS restrictions are a pain! 2) I was reminded that it's necessary to have a function return a value or other useful result of some sort.

### Day 21: June 28, 2017 
#### Time: 1.5 hours

**Today's Progress**: I worked on getting around CORS. First I read up on proxy servers, but that doesn't appear to be an option.  So I went with JSONP.  Next I began writing a function that will manipulate the DOM with the returned JSON.

**Takeaways:**  1) Even though JSONP was an easy fix, I don't like having my API key out there.  I'll need to look into other options later on.  2) I feel like I'm "daisy-chaining" a lot of callback functions; wondering if there's a more elegant way to do it, or if this is quite normal.

### Day 22: June 29, 2017 
#### Time: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: I begin adding a switch statement to handle the different results of the Ajax call.  Next I started playing with the CSS so I can test rendering an image based on the response.

**Takeaways:**  I think there must be a more elegant way where I can access ALL the returned object properties, rather than just declaring and assigning a bunch of variables.  Look into refactoring later.
